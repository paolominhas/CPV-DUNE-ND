# CPV-DUNE-ND
The ROOT/CAFE files written by me to perform analysis of large data sets of neutrino interactions simulated at the DUNE near detector (ND).

# Project Abstract:
DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment) is a long baseline neutrino
oscillation experiment. One of its many goals is to constrain Î´CP. Neutrinos are dif-
ficult to detect and uncertainties in beam production, interaction and detection are
difficult to constrain. In this report, simulations of the near detectors were used to
determine the extent to which measurement uncertainties can be constrained before
the data is compared to the far detector. Comparisons of the reconstructed energy
to the true beam energy reveal interactions and energy levels where measurement
uncertainties have a large impact on spectra, and methods to minimise this impact
are explored.
